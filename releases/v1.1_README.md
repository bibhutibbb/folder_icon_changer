# Folder Icon Changer v1.1

A simple and user-friendly tool to customize folder icons on Windows. Supports drag-and-drop for selecting folders and .ico files, with a new "Clear Icon" feature to reset folder icons.

Developed by **Bibhuti**.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Easily select folders and .ico files by dragging them into the app.
- **Change Icon**: Apply a custom .ico file to any folder.
- **Clear Icon**: Remove custom icon and reset folder to default (new in v1.1).

## What's New in Version 1.1

- **Added "Clear Icon" Button**: Removes `Icon.ico` and `desktop.ini` to reset folder icon.
- **Fixed Permission Issue**: Handles existing `Icon.ico`/`desktop.ini` files to prevent "Permission denied" errors.
- **Improved UI**: Added a sleek "Clear Icon" button alongside "Change Icon" for a consistent look.
- **Optimized EXE**: Reduced size by excluding unnecessary libraries (e.g., matplotlib, numpy).
